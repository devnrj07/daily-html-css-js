# Text to speech

Medium.com has the option to `listen to the blog` which basically reads out the whole blog to you which is cool. Another, good example is google translate or dictionary which gives you the pronounciation of the typed words. Now, that may seem awefully complex but its not and fortunately all the modern browsers these days support text to speech synthesis. Thus, we could do something similar just by using vanilla JS.
You can also change the voices, languages, playback speed and pitch of the voice. Checkout this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis"> link</a> for more details.
