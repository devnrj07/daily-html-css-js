# Sketchpad 

Today, I decided to fiddle around with HTML5 canvas api. I tried to create a sketchpad like ms paint, with basic features like `color selection` , `brush thichkness`, `Eraser` all using vanilla javascript. I also added `touch` support using events like `touchstart`, `touchmove`. Although using a library like <a href=""> hammer.js </a> would have made things a lot easier but that would have been outside this challenge to build everything using vanillaJS.


# Challenges
- canvas api (setting height, width, stroke, color)
- reading input element values via js
- touch events (single touch)
- custom cursor
