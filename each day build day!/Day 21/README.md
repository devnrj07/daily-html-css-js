# Speech to File 

Many of you would not that you can use speechrecognition right in your browser well only `chrome` and `edge` browser I was also astonished to find <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition"> this </a>while going through mdn docs. This technology is experimental but is fun to play with.
So, I decided to make something playful with it. It has two main features as of now
- listen to user speak and print on the screen
- option to download the spoken words as a txt (later I will add docx/pdf etc)
- It also prompts to download the file if you say `download the transcript`
- it supports all BCP 47 languages

# Challenges 
- SpeechRecognition api
- DOM manipulation
