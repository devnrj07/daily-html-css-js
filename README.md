  Build Somethnig Daily
</h1>

<p align="center">
  Building webpages is Fun! So, I decided to do it everyday ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯
  <br />
  Code Daily, add your small snippets built using html, css & vanillaJS 
    daily. There's no bar to what you want to build, feel free to build anything from as simple as a form to complete portfolio website.
    The idea is to practice, practice and get a good hold on html,css & JS concepts
